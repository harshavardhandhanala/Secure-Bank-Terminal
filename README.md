# SecureBank Terminal

### RFID and PIN-Based ATM Transaction Simulator using LPC2148 and Linux C

SecureBank Terminal is an embedded systems project that simulates basic ATM operations using an **ARM7 LPC2148 microcontroller**, RFID reader, 4×4 keypad, 16×2 LCD, and a Linux-based PC application.

The LPC2148 handles the hardware and user interface, while the Linux PC application manages user accounts, verifies PINs, processes transactions, and stores account details in text files.

### Working of the Architecture

- RFID reader sends the card ID to LPC2148 through UART1.
- LPC2148 sends the card ID to the Linux PC through UART0.
- Linux checks the card details in `users.txt`.
- The user enters the PIN using the keypad.
- The PC verifies the PIN and account status.
- The user selects an ATM operation.
- Linux processes the request and updates the database.
- The result is sent back to LPC2148 and displayed on the LCD.

## 3. Hardware Requirements

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| LPC2148 | Main microcontroller |
| RFID Reader | Reads RFID card number |
| RFID Card | Identifies the user |
| 4×4 Keypad | PIN and transaction input |
| 16×2 LCD | Displays ATM messages |
| MAX232 | Converts UART and RS-232 voltage levels |
| USB-to-TTL Adapter | Connects MCU UART to PC |
| Linux PC | Runs the banking application |
| Jumper Wires | Hardware connections |
| Power Supply | Provides required power |

### MAX232 Connection

LPC2148 uses TTL-level UART communication, whereas traditional RS-232 ports use different voltage levels.

- Use MAX232 when connecting to a traditional RS-232 interface.
- Use a USB-to-TTL adapter when connecting directly to a PC USB port.
- A MAX232 is generally not required with a compatible USB-to-TTL adapter.
- Always check voltage compatibility before connecting.

## 4. Pin Connections

The following connections are based on the project source code. Verify them with your actual circuit before connecting the hardware.

### 4.1 LCD Connections (16×2, 8-bit Mode)

| LCD Pin | LPC2148 Pin |
|---|---|
| D0–D7 | P0.16–P0.23 |
| RS | P0.5 |
| RW | P0.6 |
| Enable | P0.4 |
| VSS | GND |
| VDD | Suitable supply |
| V0 | Contrast adjustment |

The LCD uses an 8-bit data interface.

### 4.2 Keypad Connections (4×4)

| Keypad Line | LPC2148 Pin |
|---|---|
| Row 0 | P1.16 |
| Row 1 | P1.17 |
| Row 2 | P1.18 |
| Row 3 | P1.19 |
| Column 0 | P1.20 |
| Column 1 | P1.21 |
| Column 2 | P1.22 |
| Column 3 | P1.23 |

**Keypad Layout:**

```text
  1    2    3    A
  4    5    6    B
  7    8    9    C
  *    0    #    E
```

The numeric keys are used for PIN and amount entry. Other keys perform control operations such as backspace, confirmation, and exit.

### 4.3 UART0 Connections (LPC2148 to PC)

UART0 is used for communication between the microcontroller and Linux PC.

| Signal | LPC2148 Pin |
|---|---|
| TXD0 | P0.0 |
| RXD0 | P0.1 |
| GND | GND |

Connect TX to RX and RX to TX between the two devices.

**Communication Settings:**

- Baud Rate: 9600
- Format: 8-N-1

The baud-rate divisor must match the LPC2148 peripheral clock configuration.

### 4.4 UART1 Connections (RFID Reader)

UART1 is used to receive RFID card information.

| Signal | LPC2148 Pin |
|---|---|
| TXD1 | P0.8 |
| RXD1 | P0.9 |
| GND | GND |

**Connections:**

- RFID TX → LPC2148 RXD1 (P0.9).
- RFID RX → LPC2148 TXD1 (P0.8), if required by the reader.
- RFID GND → Common GND.

The firmware expects a framed card ID containing an 8-digit identifier. Different RFID readers may require changes to the receiving code.

## 5. Working Process

The ATM system works in the following steps:

**Step 1: Start the System**

The LCD displays the project title and waits for an RFID card.

**Step 2: RFID Card Detection**

The RFID reader reads the card number and sends it to LPC2148 through UART1.

**Step 3: Card Verification**

LPC2148 sends the card number to the Linux PC through UART0. The PC checks whether the card exists and whether the account is active.

**Step 4: PIN Entry**

If the card is valid, the LCD asks the user to enter the PIN using the keypad. The entered digits are masked on the LCD.

**Step 5: PIN Authentication**

The Linux application checks the entered PIN.

If the PIN is correct, the user can access the ATM menu. Incorrect PIN attempts are counted, and the account can be blocked after three consecutive failures.

**Step 6: Select ATM Operation**

The user can select:

- Balance Inquiry
- Deposit
- Withdrawal
- Mini-Statement
- PIN Change

**Step 7: Process Transaction**

The Linux PC processes the selected operation and updates the account balance when required.

**Step 8: Display Result**

The PC sends the result to LPC2148. The LCD displays the transaction result.

**Step 9: Exit**

The user can exit the session and return to the RFID card scanning screen.

## 6. Menu and Keypad Operations

The ATM menu contains two pages.

| Key | Operation |
|---|---|
| 1 | Balance Inquiry |
| 2 | Deposit |
| 3 | Withdrawal |
| 4 | Next Menu / Previous Menu |
| 5 | Mini-Statement |
| 6 | PIN Change |
| # | Exit Session |
| B | Backspace |
| E | Confirm Input / Screen-specific Exit |

The exact function of the control keys depends on the current LCD screen and firmware implementation.

---

## 7. UART Communication Protocol

UART0 is used to exchange messages between LPC2148 and the Linux PC.

The messages use `$` as the end marker.

### MCU to PC Messages

**1. RFID Card Number**

```text
#CARD:12535708$
```

**2. Card Number and PIN**

```text
#CARD:12535708#PIN:1234$
```

**3. Balance Inquiry**

```text
#TXN:BALANCE#REQ$
```

**4. Deposit Request**

```text
#TXN:DEPOSIT#AMOUNT:100$
```

**5. Withdrawal Request**

```text
#TXN:WITHDRAW#AMOUNT:200$
```

### PC to MCU Responses

**1. Successful Response**

```text
@OK$
```

**2. Invalid Card**

```text
@ERR#INVALID_CARD$
```

**3. Invalid PIN**

```text
@ERR#INVALID_PIN$
```

**4. Balance Information**

```text
@OK#BALANCE:7500.00$
```

These are example messages. The actual message format must match the selected MCU firmware and Linux PC application.

Both programs must use the same message format and end marker.

## 9. Setup and Execution

### A. Linux PC Application

**Requirements:**

- Linux operating system
- GCC compiler
- UART serial connection

**Step 1: Check the serial device**



**Step 2: Open the Linux project directory**



**Step 3: Compile the program**



**Step 4: Run the application**


**Step 5: Check database files**

Make sure `users.txt` and `transactions.txt` are available in the working directory.




## 10. User Database Format

The Linux application stores user details in `users.txt`.

Each user record contains six fields separated by `|`.

**Format:**

```text
CARD_ID|PIN|NAME|BALANCE|STATUS|FAILED_ATTEMPTS
```



### Field Description

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| CARD_ID | RFID card number |
| PIN | User PIN |
| NAME | Account holder name |
| BALANCE | Available account balance |
| STATUS | ACTIVE or BLOCKED |
| FAILED_ATTEMPTS | Incorrect PIN attempt count |

The PC application reads these records to authenticate users and manage accounts.

**Security Note:** These are sample credentials for demonstration. Do not use real banking PINs or personal account information.

---

## 11. Transaction History

The application stores deposit and withdrawal records in `transactions.txt`.

**Format:**

```text
CARD_ID|TRANSACTION_TYPE|AMOUNT
```


The program appends new transaction records to the file.

The mini-statement feature reads the transaction history and displays recent transactions for the authenticated user.

The exact transaction order and supported transaction types depend on the Linux application implementation.
